# Weather App

A weather application that displays the City, Temperature (K), Pressure (hPa), and humidity (%) of a specified city. The application is built using React for the front-end and Redux for the state management. All weather information is pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API, and all API calls are made using the axios library.
